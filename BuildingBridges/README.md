# Dynamic Programming | Building Bridges

Consider a 2-D map with a horizontal river passing through its center. 
There are n cities on the southern bank with x-coordinates a(1) … a(n) and n cities on the northern bank with x-coordinates b(1) … b(n).
You want to connect as many north-south pairs of cities as possible with bridges such that no two bridges cross.
When connecting cities, you can only connect city a(i) on the northern bank to city b(i) on the southern bank.
Maximum number of bridges that can be built to connect north-south pairs with the aforementioned constraints.

Input

6 4 2 1
